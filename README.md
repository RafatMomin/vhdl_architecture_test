# vhdl_architecture_test

This repository contains VHDL implementations and simulation testbenches for core components of a simplified MIPS-like processor datapath. Built and tested using **QuestaSim**, this project demonstrates a modular understanding of computer architecture concepts and design validation using waveform simulation.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

Each submodule in this repository was developed as part of a structured lab for learning and reinforcing key architectural components such as the register file, memory, ALU datapaths, bit-width extenders, and control logic. All components are testbench-verified with waveform outputs.

## âœ… Modules Implemented

- âœ… 32-register MIPS-style Register File with dual-read and single-write ports
- âœ… Structural decoder (5:32) and multiplexors (32:1, 2:1)
- âœ… Parameterized N-bit registers using flip-flops
- âœ… Sign and Zero Extenders (16-bit â†’ 32-bit)
- âœ… Word-addressable RAM using `.hex` initialization
- âœ… Full datapath with control signals for add, sub, addi, lw, sw

## ðŸ“¸ Sample Waveform

Below is a waveform screenshot showing successful simulation of datapath execution (e.g., `addi`, `add`, `sub` instructions):

## ðŸ§ª Testing

All modules were simulated using QuestaSim with custom testbenches. The repo name `vhdl_architecture_test` reflects this emphasis on testing and verification.
